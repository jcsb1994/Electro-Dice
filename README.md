# Electro-Dice

My take on a simple electronic dice! Shake the dice, and watch the LEDs roll.

## Hardware
Runs on a ATtiny13A MCU with a CR2032 battery. The STL file is available for you to download. you will just need M1.6 screws to assemble the dice halves

The PCB gerber files are currently missing. This is an old project. I may upload them later.

## Software
The code is intentionally written following C standards and directly writing to registers, even if based on the Arduino framework, which supports many C++ features.
